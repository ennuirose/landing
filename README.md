# Landing Page Project




In this project, I was tasked to convert a website from its static HTML/CSS state to a more intearctive, more responsibe UI using JavaScript and manipulating the DOM.
This has been very effective, since using the DOM allows us to control most aspect of our HTML and use it, and modify it using JavaScript functions and variables.

## Main Elements

* Manipulating The DOM using JS to modify HTML and CSS elements
* Develop a working dynamic navigation bar
* Develop an active state using getBoundingClientRect()
* Changing styles, colors and text
* Developing a scroll to top button
* Making the landing page responsive and satifying
* Mixing JavaScript with CSS to achieve higher results

## Updates

* Complete overhaul to the navigation bar code to adapt to other elements
* Rebuilt the navigation bar using different but effective methods as noted in the review
* Fixed the scroll to top button, in the earlier version it jumped instantly 
* Made the files more readable, adding eye-pleasing instructions and customization
* Implemented an active state code that highlights the current selected section and resests after changing section
* Updated the ClientRect
* Identified the element selections with the URL, making every page readable and detectable on the browser
* Changed some colors
* Made sure landing page is viewable on phones and tablets by adding specific codes that enrich the experience
* Fixed section awareness, now the user can see where they are on the section, documented by the browser too
